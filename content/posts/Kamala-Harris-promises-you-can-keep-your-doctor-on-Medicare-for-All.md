# Kamala Harris promises 'you can keep your doctor' on 'Medicare for All'


"Medicare for All" won't endanger your relationship with your doctor, according to Kamala Harris.

Harris, a senator for California and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, echoed a promise made by former President Barack Obama about his signature healthcare legislation during an appearance on ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live late Wednesday.

"People think, 'Well, maybe is this going to mean that I need to, that I'll have to worry about not being able to see my doctor,'" Harris told Kimmel. "Ninety-one percent of the doctors in America are in Medicare. And those that are not are mostly pediatricians, the 9%. And you know why they're not in Medicare because Medicare doesn't cover children. But when we have 'Medicare for All' that will not be any longer the case, which means that the vast majority of doctors will be in that system, and you can keep your doctor under that system."
