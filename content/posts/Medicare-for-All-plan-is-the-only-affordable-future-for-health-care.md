# We overpay for broken health care. Medicare for All would be much better and cost less.

### We pay more now than we would under Medicare for All. Not only can we afford it, we can't afford anything else. Our current system is unsustainable.


The usual response to Sen. Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All proposal is: “It sounds good, but how can we pay for it?” But Medicare for All will, over time, actually cost less than the current system, while providing universal care.

The notion that it is unaffordable stems partly from a misunderstanding of government estimates of future health expenditures. The Congressional Budget Office, the official source of these estimates, deals only with expenditures by the federal government, not with out-of-pocket costs. Most people don’t understand that. They naturally assume that when the CBO predicts an increase in health costs, it is referring to total costs. Not so.

In addition to government costs, total expenditures also include huge out-of-pocket costs to American families — rapidly increasing premiums, deductibles and copayments and prescription drug costs. The CBO doesn’t consider these. While income taxes for some people would have to rise to cover higher government costs, in Bernie’s plan those increases would be offset by the elimination of all out-of-pocket costs. Altogether, then, total expenditures would probably be less than in our current system, and they would certainly rise more slowly.
