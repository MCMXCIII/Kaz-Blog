# The real reason why universal coverage isn't passed yet.

A good reddit comment that addresses the situation.

As long as insurance companies exist we will never see true progress for universal coverage.

Insurance companies should not be allowed to charge hospitals and clinics unregulated. Until the United States adopts a mindset that is beneficially to the patient rather than the insurance company we will get nowhere.
